Welcome to the Red Hat Event Driven Ansible and Dynatrace escape room lab!

[#overview]
== Overview

In this escape room participants are split into groups of 4-5, and each group
has a virtual meeting room. It’s enough for one to have the laptop, and group
participates to solve challenges together. You are given tasks to solve one at
a time in your virtual workspace. After you solve a task, you write the
answer to the virtual workspace chat, and if it’s right, you’ll escape to the next
stage. A new task will be assigned to you in the chat.


[#goals]
== Lab Goals

After the lab you will hopefully understand:
* power of event driven automation
* logic how to turn monitoring into automated actions.
* basic problem finding scenario in Dynatrace
* how the events get monitored automatically in EDA
* how Ansible Controller offers job templates and audit log
* how repeating fixes for monitored issues could be automated


[#story]
= Escape room story

You are responsible for a travel agency web shop. One day you arrive at work, and
notice an email with this topic:

[quote, topic of warning email]
____
_EasyTravel webshop had a failure_
____

With link to issue tracker ticket which says it was resolved, and ticket state
is Closed.

You scroll a bit forward, and you notice another mail.

[quote, topic of action email]
____
_Easytravel webshop operations is restored_
____

There is a link to another issue tracker ticket with state Open and it says
the error was fixed and operations restored, but the root cause needs to be
analyzed. While sipping your coffee, you wonder what the heck has happened.
Time to recall how our monitoring was setup.

[#setup]
== Web Shop monitoring setup

Let's look at the above graph. It shows the following:

1. *Web Shop* is running on a RHEL host, which has *Dynatrace OneAgent* sending
   analyses to Dynatrace.
2. *Dynatrace* is continuously analyzing the VM state, and monitors the state of the
   webshop. It can trigger monitoring events, and has log of past events along
   with comments for actions regarding them.
3. *Event Driven Ansible* (EDA) instance is running Decision Environment (DE)
   which has an active *rulebook* connected to listen to Dynatrace monitoring
   events. It makes decisions to calls Ansible controller for actions based on
   the facts it has collected.
4. *Ansible Controller* has predefined *job templates* available for handling the
   web shop. It also has an API available for EDA to launch the actions, and it
   keeps *log of jobs* run. The controller launches jobs to handle the web shop.

[#action]
= Time to Action

You decide to dig into tooling to find out what caused the error, when it
happened, and how was it handled to get the web shop back to operational state.

NOTE: *Instructor will now give tasks for you to find out facts from the environment.*
